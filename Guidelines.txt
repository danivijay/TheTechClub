In order to maintain quality of content and keep group active-

1. *Irrelevant content, spam, fake news, ads = Warning/kickout*
_Members can downvote to report posts, add 'ðŸ‘Ž' by replying post- please note irrelevant downvotes may also invite warnings/kickouts_

2. *Tech related content only*
_News, Articles, Freebies, Videos/gifs, Tips/tricks, Ebooks, Other cool stuff_

3. *Post relevant content at-least once in a week*
_Members can be kicked out if found to be inactive for a longer period of time_

Let's do it together.
